# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### This project was created to analyze Kickstarter data by using different tools available in Excel. The goal of this analysis is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals to help Louise and her play *Fever*. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
This analysis was made in order to find out if launching a theater kickstarter campaign in a particular month can help it become successful. In order to do this, I analyzed the Kickstarter data by filtering all campaigns in the theater subcategory and creating a pivot table to see the outcomes based on month of campaign created. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
